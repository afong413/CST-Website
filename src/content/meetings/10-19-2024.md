# Welcome to CST!

The CST (or Computer Science Team) is College Prep's competiative programming club. Over the year, we compete in a variety of competitions including ACSL, USACO, and more. This year, we (Advika, Aiden, Samuel, and Zachary) have the pleasure of leading this club as we explore fun areas of programming and hopefully learn a few things along the way.

# Setting up Your Computer

There are many ways to run and test your code, but we sugguest running it locally as this makes it easier to debug (especially when offline) and allows for better manipulation of the interpreter/compiler.

<!-- The first thing we sugguest doing is installing [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). Homebrew is a package manager for MacOS that makes it much easier to install other pieces of software. To install Homebrew, open up Terminal and paste in:

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"` -->

We also recommend installing [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download#). To do so, head over to that link and click on Apple Silicon under Mac. VS Code is a IDE (Integrated Developer Environment) that makes programming easier, faster, and more enjoyable. There are many other IDEs and text editors, so if you already have a favorite, feel free to use that instead.

Your computer should already have a copy of Python on it. Check this by running `python3 --version` in your terminal. Some version number should be returned.
