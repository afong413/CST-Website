Caesar's Cipher encrypts a word by shifting each letter down by a specified number. If the shift takes you past the end of the alphabet, you rotate back to the front. Create a function that takes a string `s` and encrypts it using an integer `n` as the shift.

Example:

```js
encrypt("Welcome to CST", 2) // should be 'Ygneqog vq EUV"
```
